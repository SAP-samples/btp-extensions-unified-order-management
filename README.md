# Integrated Order Management Cockpit - BTP Use Case

## Description
Optimize and streamline purchase and sales order management to deal with delayed and escalated orders. Consolidate disjointed systems and tools, increase cross-team visibility, and reduce the duplication of work. End-to-end and real-time visibility into sales and purchase orders. Collaboration of procurement, customer service, and subject matter experts to handle material delays, escalations, and other issues.

## Solution Architecture
![Solution Architecture](./Solution-Diagram.png)

## Challenges
* Sales Person (at branch) and Procurement(center) do not have single source of truth while resolving material escalations.
* Duplicate and Reduntant work done by many parties in resolving escalated material issues causes further delays at customer.
* Current of using several 3rd party systems and traditional communication methods (phone/email) are not helping with the situation.

## Solution
* An integrated order management cockpit that provides end to end visibility into sales and purchase orders with a centralized cockpit where colleagues from procurement, customer service, and application engineeringÂ collaborate to handle material delays, escalations, and other issues.
* The solution is built as an extension to the ECC on the SAP Cloud Platform integrating data from ECC and leveraging SAP Hana Cloud for data modeling and interfacing capabilities.

## Requirements
* Hana cloud instantiated on SAP BTP Subaccount (Semantic Models to map data Imported from EDW HANA (side car) , also targets for replicated/federated data in production)
* Backend Server (deployed on App runtime) on SAP BTP subaccount
* Frontend / SAP Open UI5 based application deployed on SAP BTP subaccount
